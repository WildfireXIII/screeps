ENERGY MINING
==============

An energy source contains 3000 energy in it

regenerates every 300 ticks
each WORK part takes 2 resources per tick 


::formula::

WP = work parts
MA = mine actions

(3000/2) = MA
(MA/300) = WP

WP = 5?

5 * 2 * 300


every carry part only carries 50 energy




NOTE: if energy is just sitting around, it decays at one resource per tick
